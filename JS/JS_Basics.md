# JavaScript Basics

### How Computers Represent our World: (Jon Duckett)
- Computers creates models of the world with data
- Models use Objects to represent physical things
 Objects have:
  - Properties that tell us about the object
  - Methods: perform tasks utilizing the properties of the object
  - Events: triggered when a user interacts with the computer

### How to use node.js in the terminal:
- type `node-v` and return to get the version of node installed on the computer
- type `node` to enter the node program
- type the javascript commands into terminal and return to see the result. 
Example:
```
> const num = 10;
undefined
> 
> console.log(num);
10
undefined
```
Example:
```
let num1 = 16;
undefined
> console.log(num1);
16
undefined
> console.log(num1 +=1);
17
undefined
> console.log(num1 +=3);
20
```

### Remainder Operator: `%`
The remainder operator returns the remainder after dividing two numbers. For example, `4 % 2` returns `0`, and `5 % 3` returns `2`.  
The remainder operator is commonly used to find out if a value is even or odd. Even values will have a remainder `0`.
