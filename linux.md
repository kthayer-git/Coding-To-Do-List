# Linux and the Command Line

### Paths and Navigation
- **Absolute Path:** change directories by indicating the directory’s location in relation to the top level directory. Example: `cd /usr/share` (can refer to directories from any place in the filesystem, the absolute path must begin with a slash)

- **Relative Path:** change directories with reference to the the current directory. Example: cd locale (can be referenced without the leading slash) Multiple levels can be accessed using the portion of the path after the current directory’s path. Example: `cd en/LC_messages`

- `cd .. `Move up one level from the current directory
- `cd` Return to home directory regardless of present location
